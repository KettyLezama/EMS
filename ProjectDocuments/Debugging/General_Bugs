General bugs:

LOG-IN SCREEN-

    	If the incorrect log-in information is entered. The pop-up window shows a "Clo..." button.

CREATE A NEW EVENT:
    BUTTON-
	"edit" button shows a pop-up window that is resizable. Not a bug per se but it allows the user to create a weird looking window.
    END TIME DROP DOWN MENU-
	It allows for an event to end prior to a start time.

FRAME-

1. Logging out then immediately logging in with incorrect information causes the program to display an empty JFrame window.
See Logout_Login.png for the image and Logout_Login.error for the compiler error.



SUGGESTIONS:

1. Consider implementing the Enter keyboard functionality for loggin-in.
2. Allow the adminstrator to create events on other time zones.
